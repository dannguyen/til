Hi, my name is Dan and I'm a data journalist and programmer. My past work include teaching at Stanford and developing news apps at ProPublica. My main personal blog is at [blog.danwin.com](//blog.danwin.com), but I made this mini TIL blog because it seemed more fun and easy to maintain, and hopefully, it might be a useful resource for others and future me.


Read [my first TIL post for more about how I got inspired]({{'/posts/first' | relative_url}}).
