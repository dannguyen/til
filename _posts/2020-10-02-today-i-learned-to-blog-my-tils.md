Stole the idea for making a mini-blog for personal today-i-learned blurbs from [Simon Willinson](https://til.simonwillison.net/) (who, to be fair, got it from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til))

Other stuff I've learned from Simon's wonderful open-source work:

- Good practices and organization style when it comes to Click CLI interfaces, via his incredibly useful [sqlite-utils](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils) tool
- Good practices in Python packaging via his [simonw/click-app](https://github.com/simonw/click-app) repo
- Countless [SQLite tips](https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/sqlite_text-value-is-integer-or-float.md)
