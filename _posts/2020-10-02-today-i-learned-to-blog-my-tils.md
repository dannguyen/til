Today I [noticed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24659282) that the amazing [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) has a [TIL blog](https://til.simonwillison.net/), a little site for logging and organizing all the little things he's learned. He got the idea from [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) – who got the idea from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)). 

So I figured I should carry on the idea-copying and make myself a TIL repo ([dannguyen/til](https://dannguyen.github.io/til/)). And since the tradition is to keep the entries in Markdown format, I figured I might as well build a Jekyll site from it: [https://dannguyen.github.io/til/](https://dannguyen.github.io/til/)


I've been struggling with maintaining my long-running personal blog at [blog.danwin.com][//blog.danwin.com] – maybe Twitter and HN has killed my desire and rhythm for doing long-form journaling. I've had slightly better success maintaining a Word doc that I occasionally journal, including mentioning my mood and what I've decided to try learning or working on a given day. I've also enjoyed curating my repo of command-line recipes ([dannguyen/bashfoo](https://github.com/dannguyen/bashfoo)), which is not only fun and easy to do, but incredibly helpful on a day-to-day basis. 

So maybe a blog designed and focused on little TIL quips will help bridge the gap between tweets/informal diary jots and actual substantive blog posts. At the very least, I'm sure it'll be helpful to have a centralized site where I can remind myself of the tricks and concepts I've learned and later forgotten.

And I need to freshen up my Jekyll and Liquid skills – I think that Jekyll is pretty much what I want for a static site framework these days. At least, for any kind of documentation that doesn't merit a [Sphinx setup](https://github.com/dannguyen/danssphinx-template).


Since this entry is all about how Willinson got me started on TIL blogging, here's some other stuff I've learned from Simon's wonderful open-source work:

- Good practices and organization style when it comes to Click CLI interfaces, via his incredibly useful [sqlite-utils](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils) tool
- Good practices in Python packaging via his [simonw/click-app](https://github.com/simonw/click-app) repo
- Countless [SQLite tips](https://til.simonwillison.net/til/til/sqlite_text-value-is-integer-or-float.md)
