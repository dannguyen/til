    Note: this post is just a draft. Even when the subject is "something cool and simple I learned", I often don't have the time or insight to write something worth reading.

    But I also don't want to forget that I *did* learn something. So I'll make stub posts when I can, and fill out the "TKs" and "lorem ipsums" when I have the time!
